The reverse features an engraving of the painting The Declaration of Independence by John Trumbull. Throughout the $2 bill's pre-1929 life as a large-sized note, it was issued as a United States Note, National Bank Note, silver certificate, Treasury or ``Coin'' Note and Federal Reserve Bank Note. When U.S. currency was changed to its current size, the $2 bill was issued only as a United States Note. Production went on until 1966, when the series was discontinued. Ten years passed before the $2 bill was reissued as a Federal Reserve Note with a new reverse design. Two-dollar bills are seldom seen in circulation as a result of banking policies with businesses which has resulted in low production numbers due to lack of demand. This comparative scarcity in circulation, coupled with a lack of public knowledge that the bill is still in production and circulation, has also inspired urban legends about its authenticity and value and has occasionally created problems for those trying to use the bill to make purchases.\n",

      " be reassessed based on the mechanical properties of the materials since the current subbase UGMs have been shown to be over-specified.\n",
      "This finding highlights the importance of characterising the UGMs according to their mechanical properties (i.e. PD under repeated-load cycles) and to develop a constitutive model for the flexible pavement design method in Australia to predict the PD (i.e. rut) of UGMs. Moreover, the stiffness of the materials (i.e. Mr) also needs to be investigated in order to characterise the full mechanical behaviour of the UGMs.\n",
      "In this study, the tested materials ranked as Range C (i.e. incremental collapse) as shown in Table 7 according to the existing shakedown limits in Table 1 that were established by|||IP_ADDRESS|||To make frosting I needed pudding that was at a store 15 minutes away but pre-made frosting was at a store 5 minutes away.  The frosting was closer|||IP_ADDRESS||| high-quality UGMs for pavement. There can be two reasons for misspecification of these materials according to the existing boundaries. Firstly, the RLTT protocol that was used in this study was based on multiple stages of stresses, while the available shakedown boundaries were based on a single stage of stress. Secondly, the tested UGMs could be different in their properties compared to the local UGMs in other countries. Therefore, new criteria were needed to define the shakedown ranges for the local UGMs.\n",
      "Based on the observed PD behaviours from the RLTT, this study proposes a new criterion to identify shakedown ranges. Figure 10 shows typical PD curves for three UGMs. Material 1 has a dramatic collapse in comparison with Materials 2 and 3. For the purpose of pavement design, the last response of the sample is essential. The curve slope angle of the PD vs logarithm of number of loading cycles at the end of the test is the principle of the new criterion. To assign the origin of the coordinate systems, it was found that the last inflection point of the PD curve is the appropriate origin of the identified slope. The most likely explanation for this inflection point is the beginning of the failure process that can be recognised as an increase in the PD behaviour. It can be clearly seen from the example in Fig. 11 that Material 1 is in Range C, Material 2 is in Range B, and Material 3 is in Range A. Thus, the shakedown ranges can be determined according to the slope angle, Range C as 45° < angle < 90°, Range B as 22.5° < angle < 45°, and Range A as angle < 22.5° as tabulated in Table 8.\n",
      "According to the new criteria, most of the tested materials are in Range B and Range A as listed in Table 7, which indicated that these materials are acceptable as a base and subbase materials. The classification results of the new criterion are in good agreement with the crushed rock specification of VicRoads . Expected Range C has been observed for CL2B2, CL2G, CL3B1, and CL3B2 when the materials were prepared for lower MDD. In addition, when the moisture content exceeded the optimum, Range C was observed, particularly for materials CL2G and CL3B1.\n",
      "Figure 12a, b shows the vertical PD obtained at the third stage of the RLTT for specimens prepared at different ratios of moisture contents and dry densities, respectively. According to new shakedown criteria, CL2G and CL3B1, which were prepared at moisture contents above the optimum, showed incremental collapse (Range C), whereas CL3B1 and CL4B exhibit a low constant deformation (Range A) when the materials were prepared at moisture contents above the optimum. The remaining specimens were found to be in Range B as shown in Fig. 12a. When CL2B2, CL2G, CL3B1, and CL3B2 compacted at dry densities below than the maximum, Range C was observed as shown in Fig. 12b. It was concluded that the locally tested UGMs can be assigned as Range A when PD < 1%, Range B when 1% < PD < 3%, and Range C when PD > 3%.\n",
      "It was found that Ranges A and C can be easily distinguished on the basis of the PD behaviour, while Range B is found to be a bit challenging. The study recommends conducting further investigation to establish transition zones from Range A to Range B and from Range B to Range C, which could lead to better characterisation.\n",
      "In this study, three types of UGMs were used for the validation of the proposed shakedown criteria. G140-140, G140-420, and G140-700 were investigated by Werkmeister . Figure 13 shows the PD results of these materials for more than 100,000 load cycles. Table 9 presents the shakedown ranges for G140-140, G140-420, and G140-700 according to the three criteria, i.e. Werkmeister et al. , Gu et al. , and this study. It can be seen that the criteria proposed in this study are in good agreement with the criteria of Werkmeister et al.  and Gu et al. . In addition, it was observed that the new criterion achieved the same ranges in Fig. 13. Therefore, the proposed shakedown criterion could be applied for several UGMs with single- and/or multi-stage stresses. Hence, the proposed criterion could give a useful qualitative approach to assess the PD of the UGMs according to the shakedown ranges with both single and multi-stages of stresses.\n",
      "This study examined four different types of base/subbase materials used for road pavements in Australia to investigate the effect of the intrinsic and compacted layer properties on PD under repeated loads. A new shakedown criterion with new boundaries was proposed for pavement design purpose. Extensive laboratory repeated-load triaxial tests were performed by varying material gradation, moisture content, and densities.\n",
      "The results showed that the PD behaviour was influenced by several factors. Moreover, the tested subbase-specified UGMs have high PD resistance, which is almost equivalent to base-quality UGMs. These observations illustrate the requirement for new shakedown criterion for material characterisation based on PD behaviour. The shakedown ranges were identified using the new criterion, which is based on the curve slope angle of the PD vs. logarithm of number of loading cycles (0° < Range A < 22.5°, 22.5° < Range B < 45° and 45° < Range C < 90°). These boundaries were validated using several material behaviours from existing literature and were found to be consistent.\n",
      "The proposed criterion has a number of benefits over the existing criteria. First, it could provide a powerful and quick material assessment tool for the accumulation of PD. Second, it can also be applied for various UGMs with single- and multi-stage stresses. It was found that the local tested base/subbase materials can be assigned as Range A when PD < 1%, Range B when 1% < PD < 3%, and Range C when PD > 3%, which could simplify the flexible pavement design by predicting the rutting behaviour. Further investigations are required with different stress configurations to confirm these findings.\n",
