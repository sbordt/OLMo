The reverse features an engraving of the painting The Declaration of Independence by John Trumbull. Throughout the $2 bill's pre-1929 life as a large-sized note, it was issued as a United States Note, National Bank Note, silver certificate, Treasury or ``Coin'' Note and Federal Reserve Bank Note. When U.S. currency was changed to its current size, the $2 bill was issued only as a United States Note. Production went on until 1966, when the series was discontinued. Ten years passed before the $2 bill was reissued as a Federal Reserve Note with a new reverse design. Two-dollar bills are seldom seen in circulation as a result of banking policies with businesses which has resulted in low production numbers due to lack of demand. This comparative scarcity in circulation, coupled with a lack of public knowledge that the bill is still in production and circulation, has also inspired urban legends about its authenticity and value and has occasionally created problems for those trying to use the bill to make purchases.\n",

The selection of candidate genes and detection of their polymorphism sites have been considered breakthroughs of TB prevention and treatment. Curtis et al (14) found single-nucleotide polymorphisms of ASAP1 gene was associated with the susceptibility to TB in the Russian population (14), while Hu et al (23) and Miao et al (24) found no associations. This may be partly due to differences between populations and small statistical power of the follow-up studies to detect weak genetic effects. However, no case-control analysis has been reported in Xinjiang Muslim population to date. Hence, investigating the susceptibility genes in Xinjiang Muslim population may provide access to control TB in Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.\n",
      "In the present study, we tested association of ASAP1 gene polymorphism and TB susceptibility in Xinjiang Muslim population by SNP genotyping. Our data suggested that ASAP1 rs4733781 and rs1017281 polymorphisms were associated with TB susceptibility in Xinjiang Muslim population (P=0.046 and P=0.028). While no significant associations were found in rs10956514, rs1469288, rs2033059, rs12680942 and rs17285138. In contrast to our findings, Hu et al (23) and Miao et al (24) found that ASAP1 gene polymorphism was not associated with TB susceptibility in Chinese population and Tibetan population. As known, there are ethnic variations of the allelic frequency distribution in the investigated polymorphism markers (25). In addition, numerous gene studies indicated that the risk variants of genetic heterogeneity and ethnicity specificity was associated with TB (27,28). An explanation for these divergent results may involve whether polymorphism itself acts functionally and confers a truly altered susceptibility to TB disease or the associated allele was an unknown disease susceptibility allele in linkage disequilibrium. In this regard, it is necessary to note that excessive reduction of ASAP1 expression results in the impaired migration of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)-infected DCs, which may contribute to TB pathogenesis (14). Other co-variables may not be excluded, such as socio-economic factors, nutritional status, and interactions between genes (29). Therefore, in-depth study on the function of these sites is needed. In addition, in light of marginal P-values of associations between ASAP1 SNPs and TB susceptibility (P=0.046 and P=0.028), multiple corrections should be considered in our later work, such as nationality, age, sex, smoking and family history. An independent Uyghur sample will be a good option to get converse results.\n",
      "Regarding different genotype models, our results demonstrated that a trend of higher rs4733781 A allele and rs1017281 G allele in TB group compared to controls. Different genotype models revealed that subjects with rs4733781 A and rs1017281 G could be more susceptible to TB while subjects with rs4733781 T and rs1017281 A could be more resistant. The recessive model of rs4733781 (CC vs. AC+AA) in Xinjiang Muslim populations tended to be related with a lower TB risk [P=0.003, OR=0.51 (0.324-0.802)], while the recessive model of rs1017281 (GG vs. AA+AG) seemed to be related with a higher TB risk [P=0.011, OR=1.792 (1.135-2.828)]. Additionally, the linkage disequilibrium analysis showed that rs4733781 and rs1017281 were linked together, they should be considered one locus. Next, profound studies will be performed to explore the potential functional roles of these two SNPs to help understand major findings. Do they participate in the immunoreaction caused by TB? What is the exact mechanism? Much work remains to be done.\n",
      "In conclusion, ASAP1 rs4733781 and rs1017281 polymorphism may be a genetic factor for susceptibility to MTB among the Xinjiang Muslim populations. Further investigations of the functional role of SNP rs4733781 and rs1017281 and the genomic surrounding region are warranted.|||IP_ADDRESS|||Anyone else kind of tired of lazy patch notes?\n",

To qualify for PUA benefits, you must not be eligible for regular unemployment benefits and be unemployed, partially unemployed, or unable or unavailable to work because of certain health or economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",

      "To apply for unemployment benefits using the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) extension provision approved under the CARES act. In fact this approach is being used by several state unemployment agencies and while it is a cause of concern for many unemployed Americans making new claims, it is the way their systems are designed to handle the new PUA coverage and provisions. So even though it may seem like the claim was denied in reality it just means that eligible claimants have been denied for standard unemployment benefits (in place prior to Coronavirus/COVID-19), but will likely qualify for the new PUA benefits.\n",

This group of workers however may have a hard time officially proving their wages during the applicable 2019-20 wage based period, in which case their weekly benefit amount will be reduced based on whichever is higher – the record of wages already on file or the minimum PUA weekly benefit amount for the state.\n",
      "Eligible recipients must certify for PUA benefits weekly like regular unemployment. Individuals receiving PUA will also still be eligible for the $600 FPUC weekly payments.
