The overall focus on the driver of toroidal Pc5 waves has been on processes located at or acting on the dayside magnetopause and dayside flanks of the magnetosphere. These processes can generate waves that propagate tailward in the magnetosphere. However, an increasing number of studies, both theoretical and experimental, have looked at waves propagating sunward and that are caused by processes in the magnetotail. Here we present an ultra low frequency (ULF) wave observed in the post-midnight/morning sector of the magnetosphere at L=16 RE. The wave has a toroidal mode polarization. We estimate the azimuthal wave number to m=3, consistent with a toroidal mode type pulsation. The positive sign indicates that the wave is propagating sunward and this is confirmed by looking at the Poynting flux of the wave. The frequency of the wave is not constant with time but shows a small increase in the beginning of the event up to over 2.0 mHz. Then the frequency decreases to 1.0 mHz. This decrease coincides with a drop in the total magnetic field strength and we speculate if this is related to an observed reversal of the sign of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) By-component. This event occurs during relatively quiet magnetospheric conditions with a solar wind speed of approximately 400 km/s. Thus this event is highly likely to be driven by a source in the magnetotail and the change in frequency is an excellent example that the frequency of an ULF wave may be modulated by changes of the plasma parameters on the resonant field line.\n",

I have not yet learnt to make the videos look “cool” and properly “vloggy,” but I have learnt to edit automatically created transcripts. Baby steps. A crucially important aspect of this non-job has been getting to know SO MANY friendly, interested, dedicated to learning people of all ages!!! In my 12 days of vacation in Vietnam I have received many invitations to meet – and in fact, met one of the students (a nun) from this Buddhist learning community. I feel Vietnam has its arms ready for a big embrace for me (I am naive and impressionable!). By the sheer length of this point in my listicle you might figure out how excited I get talking about this… Will there be other blog reports about it? We don’t know (but likely)). This teaching makes me happy. Moving on to next point.\n",
      "(4) I helped to organize excitELT conference in Tokyo in May. I loved all about it and felt especially good about two good deeds: we collected a box of used and new graded readers and sent them to a high school in a small provincial town in Vietnam (a country where for many teachers getting graded readers to use in class with their students is utterly impossible – so isn’t it but just a little bit unfair to go and tell them how amazing extensive reading with those readers is or can be?… just thinking outloud..); at excitELT this year we also offered mentoring to presenters who felt like they wanted help with their presentation prep (it was a great experience for me and I think I’d like to do more of it! That is, help.).\n",
      "(5) I feel like a list of 5 items would be good, but what’s my number 5?… Oh yes, I’m looking into finding a job in Vietnam and moving there here. If you want to hire me or know someone who might be interested in hiring me, or just know someone or something – do leave a comment. =) Thank you kindly!\n",
      "My first trip with Teachers Helping Teachers SIG to Vietnam is over now. It was a whirlwind – and a blur. There is a lot and too much to reflect on as a result, there are projects to work on, decisions to make, new friends to keep in touch with, professional and life goals to set and work towards. You’d never think so much can happen to a person in a week’s time! But this is all material for some other posts that I will or will not write here. This one, however, is about a class I taught as part of our program and that many of YOU, readers, Twitter and Facebook friends, made possible. Here’s how it happened.\n",
      "As I mentioned earlier, the program involves some of us, volunteers with the THT SIG, guest teaching a class in the university where the seminars for teachers are later held (Hue University of Foreign Languages which has apparently been the partner and platform provider for the seminars for about 12 years). Anyway, I had never before been faced with a task to teach a class of students in a country I hadn’t even been to before and frankly, know very little about in terms of education or English education. So the first thing I did was write an email to my partner teacher.. and ask a million questions. I thought I could come across as a little over-anxious, but I needed to know certain things before thinking of a lesson plan. Things I needed to know were the following: What time exactly does the lesson start and finish? Is there any break between two periods? Who are the students? What is their major? What is their level of English? How many students can we expect in the classroom? The class is scheduled to be a listening class – does that mean that same group of students has a variety of classes throughout the week that focus on different skills? Should our lesson be a listening lesson as planned – or any other focus is possible? Would you like to team teach or would you prefer me to teach the whole time? What do you think will be best for students? Is it necessary to use the topic shown in the syllabus, including the textbook and materials that you and students have – or are you allowed to diverge from the syllabus in this guest teaching class? If it’s necessary to follow the syllabus, could you please fill me in on the important details (textbook pages, what students will have done by then, etc). And if you are allowed to have some freedom in our guest teaching time, would you have any preferences as for the topic?\n",
      "Luckily, the teacher, Ms. Phuong aka Kathy was very positive in her response and seemed happy to communicate on these and other points I had for her later. She gave very useful feedback to my lesson idea, too!\n",
      "And my idea was to have students explain things related to what they know best – their culture. Using Twitter and Facebook, I asked a simple “What would you like to know about Vietnamese culture?” – and got a list of 15 or so questions. Thank you! 🙂 Again, I so easily got the proof of how social media (AND personal) connections can empower our teaching, something I’d almost forgot about teaching in my current job.\n",
      "Fast forward to March 21st. I’m in the classrom and students slowly trickle in – and I know we won’t be starting on time (which is fine! I remember how to be flexible.) I was feeling nervous, but then I saw maybe students were kind of uneasy, too, and that’s only natural. We chatted about it a little, we smiled. I tried to use the marker on the whiteboard and it didn’t work. Ms. Phuong took a marker out of her own bag and gave it to me. Somehow, I wasn’t even surprised that would be the case – both in Russia and in Japan I carry my own markers to the classroom.\n",
      "Anyway, back to class. In the first 45-minute period we did an activity where students speculated about what my life as a Russian living and teaching English in Japan might be, on certain topics that I gave them, such as my house, my daily routine, my free time, etc (I modified one of the activities from Culture in Our Classrooms book). Time-related and other reasons prevented us from working on ALL of the questions you asked in the second period, I hope you understand.|||IP_ADDRESS|||Washing face: Then, the girl takes water with both hands and splash on her face and some water spills on the floor.

I was surprised and happy to find that most students answered almost all of the questions! After talking about their answers in pairs, they were to put their name and a smiley face on their paper IF they agreed to let me use their ideas for this blog post. 🙂 Now, this is what it’s all about.

      " 1, in which the size illusion was observed along with the depth illusion, the illusory depth gradient increase was significantly stronger than in Experiment 2, in which the size illusion was cancelled. At the first glance, the result appears paradoxical, because increasing size (pencil's diameter) decreases the depth gradient, and, hence, should weaken the depth gradient illusion. In our previous study, we investigated contrast and size illusions in the same optic flow paradigm. In particular, we discovered that in order to explain the contrast illusion, another scaling factor, in addition to viewing distance, was required. This factor was proportional to the perceived size change in the course of optic flow and significantly increased the contrast illusion compared to the size illusion. Although counterintuitive, the paradoxical effect of the object's size on its perceived depth profile revealed by Experiments 1 and 2 is explained by the same size factor scaling the perceived depth gradient (see the Appendix for more details).\n",
      "In order to account for the depth gradient illusion, we supplemented the General Object Constancy model proposed in our previous study (Qian & Petrov, 2012) with depth as a new feature (Figure 5). The model posits that the brain uses the same scaling factor for size, contrast, and depth profile, i.e., it scales retinal size, retinal contrast, and retinal disparity by a factor k(d), which is a function of viewing distance d. Because, unlike size, disparity decreases as the square of d, the factor k is squared in this case to ensure a constant depth percept. This factor alone makes the depth illusion much stronger than the size illusion. In addition, the change in perceived size contributes another factor k′, which scales both the perceived contrast and depth profile (k′ is squared in the latter case). Because of k′, the depth illusion is significantly stronger in Experiment 1, in which the perceived size increased during the contraction phase, than in Experiment 2, in which the perceived size was constant. The model provides parameter-free predictions to the results of Experiments 1 and 2 shown with the red and black curves in Figure 3, which were given by y + 1 = (x + 1)3 and y + 1 = (x + 1)2 relationships respectively. Mathematical details are discussed in the Appendix. The model also explains the results of Experiment 3, since, analogous to the contrast illusion in our previous study, the perceived depth does not factor into the perceived size calculation.\n",
      "General Object Constancy mechanism. The brain scales disparity, retinal size and retinal contrast by a factor k as a function of distance. Additionally, the perceived size change contributes another factor, k′, to the perceived contrast and the perceived depth. The contributions of both factors to depth perception are squared to ensure depth constancy.\n",
      "Our model suggests that perceived size, depth, and contrast all depend on an estimate of viewing distance. There are neurophysiological evidences showing that size perception is modulated by both feedforward signals originating from retina to primary visual cortex and feedback from high visual areas, providing viewing distance information (Fang, Boyaci, Kersten, & Murray, 2008; Liu et al., 2009; Murray, Boyaci, & Kersten, 2006; Sperandio, Chouinard, & Goodale, 2012). Moreover, single cell recordings have demonstrated gain-modulated size tuning cells in V1, V2, and V4 (Dobbins, Jeo, Fiser, & Allman, 1998), and disparity tuning cells in V1, V2, and MT (Trotter, Celebrini, Stricanne, Thorpe, & Imbert, 1992, 1996), whose firing rates depend on viewing distance. In support of our model, these findings imply that the perceived depth calculation depends on viewing distance information.\n",
      "There were studies examining whether the judgments of size, shape, and distance are independent. Brenner & van Damme (1999) tested whether adding information that improves one judgment influences the others. They found that adding distance information improved the three judgments in a consistent manner, whereas providing information about shape improved the shape (width, height, and depth) judgment, but not judgment of the size or position. Although Brenner & van Damme (1999) did not test whether manipulation of the size could influence the accuracy of shape judgment, Collett, Schwarz, and Sobel (1991) investigated how angular size and oculomotor cues interact in the perception of size and depth at different distances. Observers viewed stereoscopically simulated 3D surfaces through a darkened tunnel; thus, oculomotor cues were principal cues to distance perception. They found that estimates of the simulated depth dropped with increasing viewing distance, when surfaces were of constant angular size. But with surfaces of constant physical size, estimates were nearly independent of viewing distance—a demonstration of depth constancy. Based on these results, Collett et al. suggested that there were two components to depth scaling. One was related to viewing distance, the other was related to angular size, and their effects grew with viewing distance. They concluded that angular size and viewing distance contributed in a similar way to determine perceived size and depth. The angular size described in their study is proportional to the perceived size factor S(d) in our model (see the Appendix). Thus, these studies suggest that size perception contributes to the depth perception, supporting our model. In addition, the model is in accordance with a proposed neural mechanism of depth constancy (Bishop, 1994), which regards size and depth constancies as the first and second stages of a linked two-stage process.\n",
      "The StarTrek illusion demonstrates several strong illusions across different feature dimensions. Size and contrast illusions were studied in our previous work, in which we correlated the illusions across observers and discovered specific relationships between the two. In a similar fashion, size and depth illusions were investigated in this study. Our results demonstrate that perceptions of size, depth, and contrast, apparently independent visual features, are interconnected in a nontrivial fashion. All three are calculated from the corresponding retinal measures scaled by a common function of viewing distance. In addition, the perceived size scales retinal contrast and depth signals, sometimes producing paradoxical effects. Taken together, these results support the General Object Constancy model uniting size constancy, depth constancy, and contrast constancy phenomena into a single framework.\n",

The idea that environmental protection can underpin economic prosperity was said to have inspired local leaders to explore the green development path that has now made Anji county a model of rural sustainability and prosperity driven by eco-tourism instead of heavy industry. The surrounding landscape, as a result, has changed gradually from fields clustered with industrial facilities, including mines and a cement plant, back to peaceful farmland and rural households.

      "Shi Yulong, National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), China, highlighted the current status of rural development in China, explaining both achievements and remaining gaps. Shi reported that, on the one hand, the population living below the poverty line fell from 770 million down to 16.6 million between 1978 and 2018, and that by 2016 over 99% of villages across the country had access to paved roads, electricity, and Internet. One the other hand, Shi noted that although Anji is a success story, there are many parts of China lagging behind in terms of green development. He explained that a major part of this is the uneven distribution of population, with 96% being located on just 43% of the land, primarily in the eastern provinces. The key issue to address, he said, is the imbalance between urban and rural development, particularly the inadequacy of the latter. To illustrate, he noted that over 26% of village household waste remains untreated, and 80% of villages still do not have a sewage treatment system. Shi further underscored the scale of challenge ahead by emphasizing that although China has experienced rapid urbanization, there are still 564 million people living in rural areas, a net increase since 1949. One of the successful green rural development efforts he highlighted was the national reforestation effort, which, having returned more than 13 million hectares of farmland to forest, he described as the largest ecological project in the world.

      "ICRISAT’s approaches to building climate-smart farming communities is very interesting. Please add that the increasing number of nurseries in rural areas for medicinal and aromatic plants that grow in the arid and desert regions is also a tool to climate change adaptation, mainly for women, who generally feed the family.|||IP_ADDRESS|||The correct answer is C. the talent. Labor resources are directly related to the labor, or rather the people, the employees, that make the particular job. What they have to offer their labor resources to their heads in order to perform their work. In this case, in your labor resource is his talent for that particular position.|||IP_ADDRESS|||Please join me in congratulating the crew of STSF’s very own USS Republic as they embark on their 25th season of continuous online Star Trek Simming/Roleplay.\n",
      "We are officially one of the longest continually running online text-based Star Trek Role Playing Sims out there, playing online each week (with the rare holiday off occasionally), since 1991. We invite you all to stop by before we get the sim going to help us commemorate this auspicious day on Monday, November 14th at 11pm EST, in the sim room Republic, to help us celebrate this special day. (It's how we pick up new crew, medical sedates them, we wake them after we leave Starbase).\n",
      "We would like to invite everyone to come and remember not only your favorite moments on the Republic, things regarding the Republic, but we want to hear more about your sims as well. This is a huge milestone and one we would like to share with the entire forum if they would care to join in.  We had one year, and a great picture from Baltimore, where we had 21 of the 23 crewmembers present and in the photo. Many have remained friend through the years, vacationing together, friends on facebook and other social media together, some just chatting when they can. Of our current players, their time ranges from shortest being 14 years to a few of us at 22 years actually playing on the sim....which...wow, that's a long time!!!\n",
      "I especially have to thank my XO's, most notably Rian Kwai and Kania Kawalas, who have had to put up with me for all these years! Without you, Holly would have most definitely taken over the ship..lol. Seriously though, I appreciate your time and efforts, as I do the entire crew, who are here week in and week out.\n",
      "(You may all collect 1 \"Get out of Peril Free Card\" if you read this to the end, for use in any upcoming Season 25 sim. Must be collected in person during the anniversary sim and message me the word \"Toast\").|||IP_ADDRESS|||This morning I got a text from my husband from late last night. When we are both fully engrossed in a project we tend to slip into opposing schedules. Trevor gets engrossed in a project, doesn’t want to stop, and will work late into the night. I, on the other hand, become obsessed with going to bed as soon as possible and waking up at 5 am to get a head start on it (as I write this the clock says 5:41 am). This is great for the business, but makes us feel a bit disconnected in our relationship.\n",
      "My answer to that is that it is a wild ride, but it’s why we started our company. We are one of those sometimes gag-worthy couples that are best friends and partners in every way. We are striving for this constantly as we grow personally and professionally. We inspire and respect each other more than I have ever known in a friend or co-worker relationship. Yes we argue, or as I like to say, “need to discuss things”. We aren’t always on the same page and we both can be unbending and uncompromising at times. However, it also means we know that unequivocally we both care about Switchback as if it were another member of our family.\n",
      "A big part of our success, so far, has been to know when to lead and when to follow. Trevor has spent a large part of his career in charge of huge teams of people and has learnt amazing leadership techniques that don’t involve micromanaging and do involve inspiration through almost sport-like coaching, a tie-in from his past career life as a hockey player in the WHL.\n",
      "I have spent a huge part of my career being self-directed and a doer. The team lead of small groups. I have been the make-it-happen team member that had to both conceptualize the work, execute and present it to make it happen.\n",
      "We try to combine the two above skill sets together and mix them with unfailing respect. We find that ego never helps in this situation. The best thing we can do is tag team and feed off the other’s strength, recognizing who is best suited to lead the way in any particular situation.\n",
      "As for getting back into matching schedules, we try to go to bed at the same time three to four nights a week. We have also instated a new company policy that once a month we take a four-day weekend to reconnect and get away. This will be really important as the years go on, I can already feel it. Taking big and small moments to get away and train ourselves to disconnect from The Biz and put that energy back into our family. Just like anything, this stuff is all about training. Life is really one big training session for the things ahead. To that we say bring it on!\n",
